# About repo

So, to be clear, this repo - *just storage of mine projects about ML.*
So here you can find some simple tasks/scripts, and some ML projects.

For the most part, I do this for myself so I can track my progress and then analyze my decisions. I still don't know why this repository is public. I got one reason for this - **why not?)**

Most part of tasks and ideas for projects gonna be taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)/[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). More information about each project you can get in **README.md** in subdirectories **(soon)**.
## Libraries

For my projects and tasks i prefer to use *next libraries:*

- Python 3.12.7
- Jupyter 1.0.0
- NumPy 1.26.4
- Pandas 2.2.2
- MatPlotLib 3.9.2
- Seaborn 0.13.2
- Scipy 1.13.1
- Scikit-learn 1.5.1

Over time, I'll be adding more libraries to this list that I'll have to use later.
